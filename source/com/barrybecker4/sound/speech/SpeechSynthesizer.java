/**
 * Makes the computer speak using speech synthesis.
 * See https://www.javaworld.com/article/2075495/java-se/talking-java-.html
 *
 * The speech engine works by concatenating short sound samples that represent the smallest
 * units of human -- in this case English -- speech.
 * Those sound samples, called allophones, are labeled with a one-, two-, or three-letter identifier.
 * Some identifiers are obvious and some not so obvious, as you can see from the phonetic
 * representation of the word "hello."
 *
 * Here is an example string you could pass in other to say "Please enter a number."
 *   "p|l|ee|z e|n|t|er aa nn|u|m|b|er .|.";
 *
    h -- sounds as you would expect
    e -- sounds as you would expect
    l -- sounds as you would expect, but notice that I've reduced a double "l" to a single one
    oo -- is the sound for "hello," not for "bot," and not for "too"

    Here is a list of the available allophones that can be used to compose words:

    a -- as in cat
    b -- as in cab
    c -- as in cat
    d -- as in dot
    e -- as in bet
    f -- as in frog
    g -- as in frog

    i -- as in pig
    j -- as in jig
    k -- as in keg
    l -- as in leg
    m -- as in met
    n -- as in begin
    o -- as in not
    p -- as in pot
    r -- as in rot
    s -- as in sat
    t -- as in sat
    u -- as in put
    v -- as in have
    w -- as in wet
    y -- as in yet
    z -- as in zoo

    aa -- as in fake
    ay -- as in hay
    ee -- as in bee
    ii -- as in high
    oo -- as in go

    bb -- variation of b with different emphasis

    aer -- as in care
    ch -- as in which
    ck -- as in check
    ear -- as in beer
    er -- as in later
    err -- as in later (longer sound)
